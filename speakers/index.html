        <h3>Dan Roth</h3>
        <strong>University of Pennsylvania</strong>

</div>
<p>
<i>Bio:</i> Dan Roth is a Distinguished Professor at the Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Pennsylvania. His research focuses on the computational foundations of intelligent behavior. He and his lab develop theories and systems pertaining to intelligent behavior using a unified methodology -- at the heart of which is the idea that learning has a central role in intelligence. Recent work has emphasized the notion of incidental supervision as a way to get around the inherent difficulty in supervising complex problems. Over the last decade his lab has developed a declarative Learning Based Programming language, LBJava, for the rapid development of software systems with learned components; and is currently working on Saul, a next generation Declarative Learning Based Program.

</div>
<p>
<i>Bio:</i> Paroma Varma is a co-founder of Snorkel AI, an AI start-up based on the influential Snorkel project. Snorkel AI provides a data-first platform for building, managing, and monitoring end-to-end AI applications. Paroma received her Ph.D. from Stanford University and she was supported by the Stanford Graduate Fellowship and the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship. Her research interests revolve around weak supervision, or using high-level knowledge in the form of noisy labeling sources to efficiently label massive datasets required to train machine learning models. In this context, she is also interested in using developer exhaust, byproducts of the data analytics pipeline, to simplify complex statistical and search-based problems.
